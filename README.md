Question: The opportunity lists the following as the milestone for payment. My concern with this approach is that our team will be forced to almost work in waterfall model and not agile. We would be focussed on achieving these phases and not necessarily the agile manifesto where we can make decisions based on your priority.

Answer: The intent of this procurement is the development of a pilot project for the intake form, time tracker, project tracker and dashboard. The critical need here is to demonstrate to senior leadership the opportunity in these pilots so that continuous development will be considered where we can develop these tools further in an Agile framework.
